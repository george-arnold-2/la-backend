# Players API Server

Extremely lightweight server intended to serve as middleware to simple backend json file powering AI modeled projection data for fantasy football

Conceptually, this is a placeholder. If I ever want to monetize on the app I am developing as an actual tool for people to use, FantasyData charges $400/year for access to their API.  That would replace the use of this server but is not currently in the scope of this as a personal project simply meant to demonstrate basic skill sets with Typescript, JavaScript, React, and APIs.
